# Endless-Runner-Game
A solely developed endless runner game called "Moonbyul's Hip Adventure" inspired by Mamamoo's song and music video "Hip".

The project was completed using Python's open-source PyGame module in January of 2020 as a final school project for a grade 11 programming course.

## Short Gameplay Demo

All art was self-drawn using Clip Studio Paint, and all audio was created using FL Studio.

## Sound Credits
Credits to Mamamoo's Hip for the music and inspiration behind the game. 
The background music was a self-created cover of Mamamoo's Hip, but is heavily based off of the original track.
